## Lab 3.0 - Conditionals
[School of Computing](https://computing.unl.edu)  
[College of Engineering](https://engineering.unl.edu/)  
[University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://unl.edu)  

This lab introduces conditionals control structures using the C programming
language.

## Prior to Lab

* Read and familiarize yourself with this handout.
* Read the required chapters(s) of the textbook as
  outlined in the course schedule.

## Peer Programming Pair-Up

***For students in the online section:*** you may complete
the lab on your own if you wish or you may team up with a partner
of your choosing, or, you may consult with a lab instructor to get
teamed up online (via Zoom).

***For students in the on campus section:*** your lab instructor
will team you up with a partner.  

To encourage collaboration and a team environment, labs are be
structured in a *peer programming* setup.  At the start of
each lab, you will be randomly paired up with another student
(conflicts such as absences will be dealt with by the lab instructor).
One of you will be designated the *driver* and the other
the *navigator*.  

The navigator will be responsible for reading the instructions and
telling the driver what to do next.  The driver will be in charge of the
keyboard and workstation.  Both driver and navigator are responsible
for suggesting fixes and solutions together.  Neither the navigator
nor the driver is "in charge."  Beyond your immediate pairing, you
are encouraged to help and interact and with other pairs in the lab.

Each week you should alternate: if you were a driver last week,
be a navigator next, etc.  Resolve any issues (you were both drivers
last week) within your pair.  Ask the lab instructor to resolve issues
only when you cannot come to a consensus.  

Because of the peer programming setup of labs, it is absolutely
essential that you complete any pre-lab activities and familiarize
yourself with the handouts prior to coming to lab.  Failure to do
so will negatively impact your ability to collaborate and work with
others which may mean that you will not be able to complete the
lab.  

## Lab Objectives & Topics

At the end of this lab you should be familiar with the following

* How basic control flow works
* When and how to use `if`, `if-else`, and `if-else-if` conditional
  statements in a program

### Background

The default control flow in a typical program is sequential. That is,
each statement is executed one after the other. However, we often have
to make decisions based on program state or variable values. This is
known as conditional control flow. C, like many programming languages,
provides several control structures to alter the flow of control in a
program based on the truth-value of some conditional statement.

An `if`-statement can be used to conditionally execute a block of code. If
the condition in an `if`-statement evaluates to *true* the code block is
executed, otherwise it is not.

```c
if(x > 0) {
  printf("x is positive!\n");
  printf("the value of sqrt(x) = %f\n", sqrt(x));
}
```

An `if-else` statement can be used to execute one of two mutually
exclusive code blocks. If the condition evaluates to *true*, then the
first block is executed. Otherwise, if the condition is *false*, the
second code block is executed.

```c
if(x > 0) {
  printf("x is positive!\n");
  printf("the value of sqrt(x) = %f\n", sqrt(x));
} else {
  printf("x is not positive, cannot compute its square root\n");
}
```

An `if-else-if` statement can be used to execute one of several mutually
exclusive statements. It also requires more than one conditional
statement to determine which code block should be executed. The control
flow of an `if-else-if` statement is such that the first condition that
evaluates to true is executed. All subsequent statements are skipped. If
no condition holds true, then the else code block is executed. However,
much like the difference between an `if`-statement and an `if-else`
statement, the final `else` block is optional.

```c
if(x > 0) {
  printf("x is positive!\n");
  printf("the value of sqrt(x) = %f\n", sqrt(x));
} else if(x == 0) {
  printf("x is zero, its square root is zero\n");
} else {
  printf("x is not positive, its square root is complex:\n");
  printf("%f\n", sqrt(x*-1.0));
}
```

Yet another type of conditional control statement is a `switch` statement.
In a `switch` statement, a single variable's value is used to determine
which, among several provided cases gets executed.

```c
switch(classLevel) {
  case 1:
    printf("Freshman");
    break;
  case 2:
    printf("Sophomore");
    break;
  case 3:
    printf("Junior");
    break;
  case 4:
    printf("Senior");
    break;
  default:
    printf("ERROR: Unknown value!");
    break;
}
```

In C, the `switch` statement can only be used on integer variables (or
`char` variables since they are integers). Using `switch` statements
can also be error prone.  If you omit a `break` statement at the end
of a `case` it results in *fall through* and unexpected results.

## Compound Statements

Many logical statements require the use of *logical operators*
that can be used to form more complex, compound statements. The
three logical operators that we'll focus on are as follows.

| Operator | C Syntax | Example                  |
|----------|----------|--------------------------|
| Negation | `!`      | `!(x > 0)`               |
| And      | ` && `   | `(x != 0) && (y < 10)`   |
| Or       | <code>&#124;&#124;</code>   | <code>(x < 0) &#124;&#124; (x >= 10)</code>   |

-   Negation: this is a unary operator (an operator that only acts on
    *one* operand) that flips the truth value of the
    statement or variable that it is applied to so that true becomes
    false and vice versa.

-   Logical And: this is a binary operator that is applied to two
    logical expressions and evaluates to true if and only if both
    expressions are true

-   Logical Or: this is a binary operator that is applied to two logical
    expressions and evaluates to true if at least one (or both) of the
    expressions are true

Logical operators are necessary for more complex statements such as
checking for ranges of variable values. For example, to check if a
variable `x` lies in the range [0, 10], you would need to use the
logical and operator:

```c
if( 0 <= x && x <= 10 ) {
  printf("x is in the range [0, 10]\n");
}
```

# Activities

We have provided partially completed programs for each of the following
activities. You will need to clone the Lab 03 project from Github using
the URL: <https://github.com/cbourke/CSCE155-C-Lab03>. Refer to previous
labs for a step-by-step process.

## Tax Program

The federal income tax for a married couple filing jointly
for 2021 is determined by the rules indicated in the following
table.  

| If the AGI is over | But not over | Tax is:            | Of the amount over |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| \$0                | \$19,900     | 10%                | \$0                |
| \$19,901           | \$81,050     | \$1,990 + 12%      | \$19,900           |
| \$81,051           | \$172,750    | \$9,328 + 22%      | \$81,050           |
| \$172,751          | \$329,850    | \$29,502 + 24%     | \$172,750          |
| \$329,851          | \$418,850    | \$67,206 + 32%     | \$329,850          |
| \$418,851          | \$628,300    | \$95,686 + 35%     | \$418,850          |
| \$628,301          | --           | \$168,933.50 + 37% | \$628,300          |

In addition, the total tax is reduced by $2,000 for each
child that a couple has but cannot make the tax liability
less than zero (for the purposes of this exercise).  

We have provided a partially completed program that reads in a user's
Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and prompts whether or not they have any
children. If they do it prompts them for how many. Complete the program
by computing the user's total tax based on the user's AGI the number of
children they have.

Some example input/output results can be found in the following
table.  For example, if the user has an adjusted gross income of
\$150,000 and has 4 children, then their tax would be calculated
as follows.

-   Their AGI falls in the 3rd tax bracket and so would be
    $9,328 + 22% of the amount over $81,050 or

    $9,328 + 22% * ($150,000 - $81,050) = $24,497.00

-   With 4 children, they have a $8,000 tax credit giving
    a new total of $16,497.00

| AGI       | Number of kids | Tax Total    |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| \$4,000   | 1              | \$0.00       |
| \$20,000  | 0              | \$2,002.00   |
| \$120,000 | 3              | \$11,897.00  |
| \$150,000 | 4              | \$16,497.00  |
| \$250,000 | 0              | \$48,042.00  |
| \$500,000 | 5              | \$114,088.50 |

## Calculator Program

In this activity, you will implement a simple menu-based command line
calculator. A partially completed program has been provided to you,
`calculator.c`. The program prompts the user for two operands (values)
and one of several choices for an operation to be performed on
them. Your program should process the input and display the result of
the chosen operation. Take care with the following *edge cases*:

-   For division, you should check if the divisor, `b` is zero
    (division by zero is not defined). If it is, an appropriate
    error message should be output instead of a result and
    **must** include the keyword `ERROR`.

-   For the logarithm operation, you should use the math library's
    `log` function, which is the natural logarithm (base *e*). To
    change to another base, use the formula:

    $$\log_a{(b)} = \frac{\ln{(b)}}{\ln{(a)}}$$

    In addition, you should check that both operands are positive.
    If one or both are not positive, output an appropriate error
    message.

**Reminder:** when compiling on CSE you may need to direct `gcc`
that it needs to *link* the math library by giving it the `-lm`
(**l**ink **m**ath) flag; for example:

`gcc -lm calculator.c`

On the CS50 IDE (ubuntu) you would include the flag at the end:

`gcc calculator.c -lm`

Complete the program and thoroughly test it.

## Leap Years

Nearly every 4 years is a *leap year* in the Gregorian calendar. In a
leap year, there are 366 days (adding February 29th) instead of the
usual 365. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by
4. However, every year that is divisible by 100 is *not* a leap year
unless it is divisible by 400. 2000, 2004, 2008 were leaps years
but 2001, 2002, 2003 were not. 1900 was not a leap year; though it was
divisible by 4 it was divisible by 100 but *not* 400.

We've provided a partially completed program, `leapYear.c` that
tests whether or not various years are leap years.

1.  Implement a conditional statement inside the `isLeapYear()`
    function to determine if the given `year` is a leap year or not.
    Return true (`1`) if it is, false (`0`) if it is not.

2.  Compile and run your program: we've provided 3 hard-coded test
    cases. Fix any errors in your program until they all ***pass***.

3.  Using the provided code as an example, *at least* 3 more test
    cases to your program. Repeat your compile/run/test until they all
    ***pass***.

# Handin/Grader Instructions

1.  Hand in your completed files:

    -   `taxes.c`

    -   `calculator.c`

    -   `leapYear.c`

    through the online handin system.  Be sure your program
    passes all tests to get credit.

2.  Even if you worked with a partner, you *both* should turn in all
    files.

# Advanced Activities (Optional)

1.  Another conditional operator is the ternary if-then-else operator.
    It is often used to choose between two values. For example:
    `int min = ( (a < b) ? a : b );` The syntax, `X ? Y : Z` is
    as follows: `X` is any conditional statement; if it evaluates to
    true, then the expression takes on the value `Y`; otherwise it
    takes on the value `Z`. Modify your programs to use this ternary
    operator where appropriate.

2.  Change the calculator program as follows: add a menu option so that
    the user has the option to quit; then add a loop so that the program
    continues to print the menu. As long as the user performs an
    operation, it should continue until the user selects the quit
    option.
